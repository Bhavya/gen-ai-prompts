## Example Usage

"I need help preparing for a Senior Software Engineer interview at a Series B startup. 5 rounds: recruiter screen, technical phone screen (1 hour coding), system design (1 hour), 3-hour onsite (coding + behavioral + team fit), final round with VP Engineering. I'm strongest in Python and have 6 years backend experience. Worried about system design since I've mostly worked on smaller scale systems. Interview is in 3 weeks. Want to focus prep on highest-impact areas."
