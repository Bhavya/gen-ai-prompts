# Creative Problem Solving - OpenAI Optimized

## Purpose
A dynamic, creative problem-solving prompt optimized for GPT-4o's innovative thinking and conversational abilities.

## OpenAI-Optimized Prompt

```
Hey! I've got a challenging problem that could really benefit from some creative thinking and fresh perspectives. Let's brainstorm this together and come up with some innovative solutions.

## The Challenge:
[Describe your problem or challenge here]

## What I've Already Tried:
[Share previous attempts or conventional approaches you've considered]

## Constraints & Requirements:
[Any limitations, requirements, or must-haves]

Let's think outside the box on this one! I'm looking for:

ðŸ§  **Creative Angles**: What unique perspectives or approaches haven't been considered?

ðŸ’¡ **Innovative Solutions**: Fresh ideas that might challenge conventional thinking

ðŸ”€ **Cross-Industry Inspiration**: What solutions from completely different fields might apply?

ðŸš€ **Blue-Sky Thinking**: If resources/constraints weren't an issue, what would be possible?

âš¡ **Quick Wins**: Are there any unconventional but fast-to-implement ideas?

ðŸŽ¯ **Hybrid Approaches**: How could we combine different strategies in novel ways?

Feel free to:
- Ask clarifying questions to better understand the problem
- Suggest wild ideas that we can refine later
- Build on ideas iteratively as we chat
- Challenge my assumptions about what's possible
- Draw connections to unexpected domains or examples

What creative solutions come to mind? Let's explore some possibilities together and see where the conversation takes us!
```

## Why This Works Well with OpenAI

- **Conversational Flow**: Natural, engaging dialogue that builds momentum
- **Creative Encouragement**: Explicitly asks for innovative and unconventional ideas
- **Iterative Building**: Takes advantage of GPT-4o's ability to build on ideas through conversation
- **Open-Ended Exploration**: Allows for creative tangents and unexpected connections
- **Interactive Approach**: Encourages back-and-forth discussion rather than one-way analysis

## Usage Tips

1. Be open to unexpected suggestions and build on them
2. Don't shut down "wild" ideas too quickly - they often lead to practical innovations
3. Ask follow-up questions to develop interesting concepts further
4. Encourage GPT-4o to challenge your assumptions
5. Use the conversation to explore multiple directions before settling on solutions

## Follow-Up Conversation Starters

- "That's interesting! How would that work in practice?"
- "What if we took that idea but applied it to [specific context]?"
- "I like the direction, but what if we had [different constraint]?"
- "Can you help me think through the potential downsides of that approach?"
- "What would a minimal version of that solution look like?"

## Example Usage

"Hey! I've got a challenging problem that could really benefit from some creative thinking. Our engineering team is struggling with code review bottlenecks - reviews are taking 3-5 days and blocking deployments. 

What I've already tried: Added more senior reviewers, created review checklists, set SLA targets (didn't work).

Constraints: Team of 12 developers, can't hire more seniors immediately, need to maintain code quality standards.

Let's think outside the box - what creative approaches might solve this differently than just 'more/faster reviews'?"
