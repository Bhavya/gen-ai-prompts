## Gemini-Optimized Prompt

```
I need a comprehensive, data-driven analysis to inform a decision. Please help me structure this analysis with quantitative rigor and thorough research.

## Analysis Request:
[Clearly state what you need to analyze or decide]

## Available Data:
[Provide any quantitative data, metrics, or measurable information you have]
- Historical performance data
- User metrics and analytics
- Financial information
- Survey results or feedback data
- Competitive benchmarking data
- Technical performance metrics

## Key Questions to Answer:
1. [Specific question requiring data analysis]
2. [Another measurable question]
3. [Quantifiable decision criteria]

## Analysis Framework Requested:

### 1. Data Assessment & Validation
- Evaluate the quality and completeness of available data
- Identify data gaps and suggest additional sources
- Assess statistical significance and reliability
- Recommend data collection improvements if needed

### 2. Quantitative Analysis
- Perform relevant statistical analysis on the data
- Identify trends, patterns, and correlations
- Calculate key metrics and performance indicators
- Provide confidence intervals or uncertainty ranges where appropriate

### 3. Comparative Analysis
- Benchmark against industry standards or competitors
- Compare multiple options using weighted criteria
- Analyze cost-benefit ratios and ROI projections
- Evaluate risk-adjusted returns or outcomes

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Project future trends based on historical data
- Model different scenarios and their likely outcomes
- Identify key variables that drive performance
- Assess sensitivity to changes in assumptions

### 5. Evidence-Based Recommendations
- Rank options based on quantitative criteria
- Provide confidence levels for recommendations
- Identify key metrics to monitor for success
- Suggest A/B testing or pilot program approaches

## Success Criteria:
[How will success be measured? What are the target metrics?]

## Constraints & Requirements:
- Budget limitations: [If applicable]
- Timeline requirements: [Decision deadline]
- Risk tolerance: [Conservative vs. aggressive approach]
- Resource constraints: [Team, technology, etc.]

## Research Requirements:
If additional data or research is needed, please:
- Suggest specific data sources or research methodologies
- Recommend key metrics to track
- Identify benchmarking opportunities
- Propose validation methods for assumptions

Please provide a structured analysis with clear methodology, quantified results, and data-backed recommendations. Include relevant charts, metrics comparisons, and statistical analysis where appropriate.

## Why This Works Well with Gemini

- **Research Integration**: Leverages Gemini's strong research and information synthesis capabilities
- **Quantitative Focus**: Emphasizes data, metrics, and measurable outcomes
- **Structured Methodology**: Provides clear analytical framework that Gemini can follow systematically
- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Focuses on factual analysis rather than subjective opinions
- **Practical Application**: Requests actionable insights based on data

## Usage Tips

1. Provide as much quantitative data as possible upfront
2. Be specific about the decision criteria and success metrics
3. Ask for statistical analysis and confidence levels
4. Request benchmarking against relevant standards
5. Ask for validation methods and ways to test assumptions

## Expected Output Types

- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
- Comparative tables and ranking matrices
- Trend analysis and projections
- Risk assessment with quantified probabilities
- ROI calculations and financial modeling
- Recommendations with supporting data

## Example Usage

"I need a data-driven analysis to decide between three product development approaches. 

Available data: 6 months of user engagement metrics (DAU: 50k, retention: 65% month-1), development cost estimates ($200k, $350k, $500k), competitive analysis showing 3 main rivals with 15%, 25%, 12% market share respectively.

Key questions: Which approach maximizes ROI over 18 months? What's the risk-adjusted NPV? How do we compare to competitor strategies?

Success criteria: >20% revenue growth, <$400k investment, ship within 9 months."
