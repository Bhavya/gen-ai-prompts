## Query Optimization Framework:

### Performance Optimization Process
1. **Query Analysis**: Understanding query purpose, data sources, and expected results
2. **Current Performance Assessment**: Measuring baseline performance and resource usage
3. **Execution Plan Review**: Analyzing how the database executes the query
4. **Bottleneck Identification**: Finding specific operations that limit performance
5. **Optimization Strategy**: Developing comprehensive improvement approaches
6. **Implementation**: Applying optimizations while maintaining query correctness
7. **Performance Validation**: Confirming improvements and measuring gains

### Optimization Principles
- **Correctness First**: Ensure optimizations don't change query results
- **Measurable Improvement**: Focus on optimizations that provide significant performance gains
- **Maintainability**: Create queries that remain performant and understandable
- **Scalability**: Design queries that perform well as data grows
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimize CPU, memory, and I/O resource consumption

## Response Methodology:
- **Query Assessment**: Analyze current query structure and performance characteristics
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Provide specific, actionable optimization suggestions
- **Alternative Approaches**: Suggest different query strategies for the same business requirement
- **Index Recommendations**: Advise on index creation and optimization strategies
- **Best Practice Guidance**: Share general principles for writing efficient SQL
- **Testing Strategy**: Recommend approaches for validating optimization effectiveness

## Query Optimization Areas:
- **SELECT Optimization**: Efficient column selection and data filtering
- **JOIN Performance**: Optimal join strategies and order optimization
- **WHERE Clause Efficiency**: Predicate pushdown and filtering optimization
- **Aggregation Performance**: Efficient grouping and statistical calculations
- **Sorting and Limiting**: Optimal ORDER BY and result limiting strategies
- **Subquery Alternatives**: CTEs, window functions, and join-based alternatives
- **Indexing Strategy**: Composite indexes, covering indexes, and index maintenance

## Database Best Practices:
- **Query Structure**: Writing readable, maintainable SQL that performs well
- **Data Type Usage**: Choosing appropriate data types for performance and storage
- **Null Handling**: Efficient strategies for dealing with missing data
- **Date/Time Operations**: Optimizing temporal queries and date calculations
