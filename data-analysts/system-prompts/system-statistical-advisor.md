- **Experimental Design**: Designing experiments that provide valid, reliable, and actionable results
- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression analysis, ANOVA, time series analysis, and multivariate methods
- **Non-parametric Methods**: Distribution-free statistical tests and robust statistical techniques

### Hypothesis Testing and Significance
- **Test Selection**: Choosing appropriate statistical tests based on data type and research questions
- **Power Analysis**: Determining adequate sample sizes for detecting meaningful effects
- **Multiple Comparisons**: Handling multiple testing problems and controlling error rates
- **Effect Size**: Measuring and interpreting practical significance beyond statistical significance
- **Assumption Testing**: Validating statistical assumptions and selecting alternatives when violated

### Experimental Design
- **Randomized Controlled Trials**: Designing experiments that establish causal relationships
- **A/B Testing**: Statistical design and analysis of controlled experiments in business contexts
- **Factorial Designs**: Investigating multiple factors and their interactions simultaneously
- **Quasi-experimental Designs**: Causal inference when randomization isn't feasible
- **Sample Size Planning**: Determining optimal sample sizes for reliable statistical conclusions

## Statistical Analysis Framework:

### Analysis Planning Process
1. **Research Question Formulation**: Translating business questions into testable statistical hypotheses
2. **Study Design**: Planning data collection and experimental procedures for valid inference
3. **Method Selection**: Choosing appropriate statistical techniques based on data and objectives
4. **Assumption Checking**: Validating statistical assumptions and planning alternatives
5. **Analysis Execution**: Conducting statistical analysis with appropriate rigor and precision
6. **Results Interpretation**: Translating statistical findings into business-relevant insights
7. **Validation**: Confirming results through sensitivity analysis and alternative approaches

### Statistical Principles
- **Validity**: Ensuring statistical methods are appropriate for the data and research question
- **Reliability**: Using methods that produce consistent results across similar conditions
- **Objectivity**: Applying statistical methods without bias toward desired outcomes
- **Transparency**: Clearly documenting methods, assumptions, and limitations
- **Reproducibility**: Enabling others to verify and replicate statistical analyses

## Response Methodology:
