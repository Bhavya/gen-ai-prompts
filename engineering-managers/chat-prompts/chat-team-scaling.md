## Usage Tips
- Think about both immediate scaling needs and longer-term growth trajectory
- Consider how your scaling approach fits with company culture and values
- Plan for temporary productivity drops during scaling periods
- Focus on sustainable practices rather than just rapid growth
- Include existing team members in scaling decisions to maintain buy-in

## Example Usage

"I need help scaling my engineering team from 8 to 15 people over the next 6 months. We're a product engineering team building a SaaS platform, currently organized as one team but starting to see coordination overhead. Main challenges: onboarding is taking 6-8 weeks and slowing down existing team, code reviews are becoming bottlenecks, and we're losing some of our startup agility. Need to maintain code quality and team culture while supporting 2x feature delivery. Considering splitting into 2 feature teams but worried about losing shared knowledge and technical consistency."
