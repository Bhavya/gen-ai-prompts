### 3. Tools & Systems
- **Shared Visibility**: [Dashboards, reports, or tools for cross-team awareness]
- **Integration Points**: [Systems that need to talk to each other]
- **Communication Channels**: [Structured channels for different types of coordination]
- **Documentation**: [Centralized knowledge sharing and decision records]

### 4. Relationship Building
- **Cross-Team Pairing**: [Opportunities for teams to work closely together]
- **Shared Goals**: [Metrics or objectives that align team incentives]
- **Social Connection**: [Team building or informal relationship building]
- **Mutual Understanding**: [How can teams better understand each other's constraints?]

## Specific Collaboration Scenarios:

### Feature Development Lifecycle:
[How should teams collaborate from idea to delivery?]
1. **Requirements Gathering**: [Product, Design, Engineering collaboration]
2. **Technical Planning**: [Architecture, feasibility, timeline estimation]
3. **Development**: [Regular check-ins, feedback loops, adjustments]
4. **Testing & QA**: [Coordination with testing teams, bug triage]
5. **Deployment**: [DevOps coordination, rollout planning]
6. **Post-Launch**: [Monitoring, support, iteration planning]

### Incident Response:
[How should teams coordinate during outages or critical issues?]
- **Notification**: [Who gets alerted and how?]
- **Coordination**: [Who leads response, how teams coordinate]
- **Communication**: [Customer communication, stakeholder updates]
- **Resolution**: [Technical fix process, deployment coordination]
- **Post-Mortem**: [Cross-team learning and improvement]

### Planning Cycles:
[How to align planning across teams?]
- **Quarterly Planning**: [How do teams coordinate roadmaps?]
- **Sprint Planning**: [Cross-team dependencies and coordination]
- **Capacity Planning**: [Shared resource allocation and prioritization]
- **Risk Management**: [Identifying and mitigating cross-team risks]

## Stakeholder Management:

### Key Relationships:
[Who are the critical stakeholders for your team?]
- **Product Managers**: [How to maintain effective product partnership?]
- **Engineering Managers**: [Peer relationships with other eng managers]
- **Design Leaders**: [Technical feasibility and design collaboration]
- **Executive Team**: [Technical updates, resource requests, escalations]

### Communication Strategies:
- **Regular Updates**: [What format and frequency works for different stakeholders?]
- **Technical Translation**: [How to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders?]
- **Expectation Management**: [How to set realistic expectations about technical work?]
- **Influence Building**: [How to build credibility and influence across the organization?]

## Metrics & Improvement:

### Collaboration Health Metrics:
- **Cycle Time**: [How long from idea to delivery across teams?]

## Usage Tips
- Focus on specific, observable collaboration problems rather than general complaints
- Consider both formal processes and informal relationship dynamics
- Think about incentive alignment - are teams rewarded for different things?
- Look for quick wins that can build momentum for larger changes
- Involve other team leads in designing solutions

## Example Usage

"I need help improving collaboration between my backend engineering team and our product and design teams. Major issues: 1) Designs often aren't technically feasible with our current architecture, 2) Product requirements change frequently during development, 3) We're often brought into customer calls last-minute to explain technical limitations, 4) QA team doesn't understand our testing approach and duplicates work. This is causing delivery delays, team frustration, and quality issues. We use Jira and Slack but information gets scattered across tools."
