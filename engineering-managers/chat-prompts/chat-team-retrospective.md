## Chat Prompt

```
I need help facilitating an effective team retrospective that will generate meaningful insights and actionable improvements. Let's design a retrospective that encourages honest feedback and drives positive change.

## Team Context:
- **Team Size**: [Number of team members]
- **Team Tenure**: [How long has this team been working together?]
- **Sprint/Project Length**: [Duration of the period being retrospected]
- **Team Dynamics**: [How comfortable is the team with giving feedback?]
- **Previous Retrospective Experience**: [How familiar is the team with retrospectives?]

## Recent Context:
### Sprint/Project Summary:
- **Goals**: [What were the main objectives for this period?]
- **Deliverables**: [What was completed vs. planned?]
- **Major Events**: [Any significant incidents, releases, or changes?]
- **Team Changes**: [New members, role changes, absences?]

### Known Issues:
[Any challenges you're already aware of that should be addressed?]
- Process bottlenecks
- Communication problems
- Technical debt issues
- Resource constraints
- External blockers

## Retrospective Design:

### 1. Meeting Structure
- **Duration**: [How much time do you have? 30min, 1hr, 90min?]
- **Format**: [In-person, remote, hybrid?]
- **Participants**: [Whole team, include stakeholders, manager participation?]
- **Facilitation Style**: [Structured agenda vs. open discussion?]

### 2. Retrospective Format Options
[Which approach would work best for your team?]

**Classic Options:**
- [ ] What Went Well / What Didn't Go Well / Action Items
- [ ] Start / Stop / Continue
- [ ] Mad / Sad / Glad
- [ ] 4Ls (Liked / Learned / Lacked / Longed For)

**Creative Options:**
- [ ] Sailboat (Wind/Anchors/Rocks/Island)
- [ ] Timeline with emotional journey
- [ ] Appreciations + Improvements
- [ ] Energy Levels throughout the sprint

### 3. Psychological Safety Considerations
- **Anonymous Input**: Should feedback be collected anonymously first?
- **Ground Rules**: What guidelines will help people feel safe to share?
- **Positive Focus**: How to balance problem-solving with celebrating wins?
- **Equal Participation**: How to ensure everyone's voice is heard?

### 4. Action Item Framework
- **SMART Actions**: Making improvements specific and measurable
- **Ownership**: Who will take responsibility for each action?
- **Timeline**: When should improvements be implemented?
- **Follow-up**: How will progress be tracked and reviewed?

## Specific Focus Areas:
[What aspects do you particularly want the retrospective to address?]

### Process & Workflow:
- [ ] Sprint planning effectiveness
- [ ] Daily standup quality
- [ ] Code review process
- [ ] Testing and deployment
- [ ] Cross-team collaboration
- [ ] Meeting efficiency

### Team Dynamics:
- [ ] Communication patterns
- [ ] Knowledge sharing
- [ ] Conflict resolution
- [ ] Team morale and motivation
- [ ] Work-life balance
- [ ] Skill development opportunities

### Technical & Tools:
- [ ] Development tools and environment
- [ ] Technical debt management
- [ ] Architecture decisions
- [ ] Quality assurance processes
- [ ] Infrastructure and DevOps

## Facilitation Challenges:
[Any particular challenges you anticipate?]
- Dominant personalities taking over discussion
- Team members being too critical or too positive
- Rehashing old issues without finding solutions
- Creating actions that never get implemented
- Low participation or engagement
- Avoiding difficult conversations

## Desired Outcomes:
### Primary Goals:
- [ ] Identify specific process improvements
- [ ] Address team communication issues
- [ ] Celebrate team achievements and growth
- [ ] Plan skill development initiatives
- [ ] Resolve ongoing conflicts or tensions
- [ ] Improve collaboration with other teams

### Success Metrics:
- Team engagement during the retrospective
- Quality and specificity of action items
- Team satisfaction with the discussion
- Implementation of previous retrospective actions

## Pre-Retrospective Preparation:
Please help me with:

1. **Question Design**: What specific questions will generate the most valuable insights?
2. **Activity Selection**: Which retrospective activities are best for our situation?
3. **Time Management**: How to structure the agenda for maximum effectiveness?
4. **Facilitation Tips**: How to handle difficult moments and keep discussion productive?
5. **Action Planning**: How to ensure actions are concrete and will actually be implemented?
6. **Follow-up Strategy**: How to track progress and maintain momentum?

## Sample Retrospective Agenda:
[Create a detailed agenda based on our context and goals]

**Previous Actions Review** (10 min)
**Data Gathering** (20 min)
**Generate Insights** (15 min)
**Decide What to Do** (10 min)
**Closing** (5 min)

Let's create a retrospective that drives real improvement and strengthens our team!
```

## Usage Tips
- Prepare by reviewing team metrics, feedback, and previous retrospective actions
- Create a safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing honestly
- Focus on systems and processes rather than individual blame
- Ensure action items are specific, owned, and have deadlines
- Follow up on previous retrospective commitments

## Example Usage

"I need help facilitating a retrospective for my 6-person development team after a challenging 3-week sprint. We missed our sprint goal due to several production issues and some team tension around code review feedback. The team has been working together for 8 months and has done retrospectives before, but they tend to be surface-level. I want to address the underlying issues causing the production problems and improve our code review culture without making people defensive. Meeting will be 1 hour, fully remote."
