## Example Usage

"I need help addressing performance issues with a mid-level developer who joined our team 8 months ago. They're technically competent but consistently miss deadlines, their code requires extensive rework during reviews, and they don't communicate blockers until it's too late. This is affecting team velocity and other developers are frustrated. The person seems overwhelmed and defensive when given feedback. I want to help them succeed but need to see improvement quickly as we have critical projects coming up."
