## Example Usage

"I'm dealing with a conflict between two senior developers on my team. Alex believes we should refactor our authentication system before adding new features, while Sam wants to deliver the roadmap features on schedule and deal with tech debt later. Their disagreements have become personal, with Alex calling Sam's code 'sloppy' in a team meeting and Sam accusing Alex of 'gold-plating' and blocking progress. The tension is affecting the whole team, and our next release is in 3 weeks. Both are strong performers but have very different approaches to software quality vs. delivery speed."
