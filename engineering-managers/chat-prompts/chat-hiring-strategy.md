## Example Usage

"I need to hire 3 engineers for my 5-person team over the next 4 months: 1 senior backend engineer, 1 mid-level frontend developer, and 1 DevOps engineer. Current team is strong technically but we're struggling with scaling our Node.js/React platform and deployment processes. Budget allows for $120-180k salaries. Main challenges: competing with big tech companies for talent, our stack isn't the newest/sexiest, and we need people who can work independently since we're a fast-moving startup. Remote-first company but prefer US timezones."
