## Example Usage

"I need help establishing a metrics framework for our B2B project management SaaS. We're in growth stage with 5k users, focusing on moving upmarket to mid-size teams. Current goals: increase MRR by 200% this year, reduce churn below 5%, improve user engagement. Currently tracking basic metrics like signups and revenue, but need better visibility into user behavior, feature adoption, and leading indicators of churn. Team has limited analytics experience and we're using Google Analytics plus our own database queries."
