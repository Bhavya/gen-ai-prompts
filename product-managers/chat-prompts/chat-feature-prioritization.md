## Purpose
A systematic approach to evaluating, scoring, and prioritizing product features based on multiple criteria and strategic objectives.

## Chat Prompt

```
I need help prioritizing features for my product roadmap. Let's work through a systematic evaluation process to make data-driven prioritization decisions.

## Product Context:
- **Product**: [Brief description of your product]
- **Target Users**: [Primary user segments]
- **Business Model**: [How you monetize]
- **Current Stage**: [Startup/Growth/Mature]
- **Team Size**: [Development team capacity]

## Strategic Objectives:
[Rank your top 3-5 objectives:]
- [ ] Increase user acquisition
- [ ] Improve user retention/engagement
- [ ] Increase revenue per user
- [ ] Reduce churn
- [ ] Improve user satisfaction/NPS
- [ ] Competitive differentiation
- [ ] Market expansion
- [ ] Technical debt reduction
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

## Features to Prioritize:
[List the features you're considering - be as specific as possible:]

1. **Feature Name**: [Brief description]
   - **User Story**: [Who wants this and why]
   - **Estimated Effort**: [T-shirt size: XS/S/M/L/XL or story points]

2. **Feature Name**: [Brief description]
   - **User Story**: [Who wants this and why]
   - **Estimated Effort**: [T-shirt size or story points]

[Add more features...]

## Available Data:
[Share any relevant data you have:]
- User research insights
- Feature request frequency/volume
- Usage analytics
- Customer feedback themes
- Competitive analysis
- Revenue impact estimates

## Constraints:
- **Timeline**: [When do you need to decide/ship]
- **Resources**: [Development capacity, dependencies]
- **Technical**: [Platform limitations, technical debt]
- **Business**: [Budget, compliance, partnerships]

Please help me:

1. **Evaluation Framework**: Create a scoring system that aligns with my strategic objectives
2. **Feature Scoring**: Rate each feature across relevant criteria (impact, effort, confidence, etc.)
3. **Prioritization Matrix**: Organize features using a structured prioritization method
4. **Roadmap Sequencing**: Recommend the order for implementation considering dependencies
5. **Decision Documentation**: Create a clear rationale for prioritization decisions

Let's create a transparent, repeatable process for making these prioritization decisions.
```

## Usage Tips
- Be honest about effort estimates - include unknowns and risks
- Consider user feedback volume AND user value (enterprise vs. individual users)
- Factor in technical dependencies and sequencing requirements  
- Think about learning opportunities - which features will teach you the most
- Include "table stakes" features that are necessary but not differentiating

## Common Evaluation Criteria
- **Impact**: How much will this move key metrics?
- **Effort**: Development time and complexity
- **Confidence**: How sure are you about impact estimates?
- **Strategic Alignment**: How well does this support business objectives?
- **User Value**: How much will users benefit?
- **Competitive Advantage**: Does this differentiate you?
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity and unknowns

## Example Usage

Features to consider:
1. Advanced reporting dashboard - Power users want custom analytics (Effort: L)

3. Slack integration - Top requested integration (Effort: M)
4. Team collaboration features - Comments, @mentions (Effort: L)
5. API access - Enterprise prospects asking for this (Effort: M)

User research shows mobile is most requested, but our paid conversion data suggests advanced features drive upgrades."
