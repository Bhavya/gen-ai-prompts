## Example Usage

"I need help creating a PRD for adding team collaboration features to our project management tool. The problem: teams are using external tools (Slack, email) for project communication, causing context switching and lost information. Solution concept: integrated team chat and file sharing within project workspaces. Target users are project managers and team members at 50-200 person companies. Need to define specific features, success metrics, and technical requirements for our development team."
