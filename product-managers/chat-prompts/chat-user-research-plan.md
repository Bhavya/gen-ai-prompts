## Example Usage

"I need help designing user research for our new project management feature. We're trying to understand how teams currently track project progress and what would make them switch from spreadsheets to our tool. Target users are project managers at 50-500 person companies. Have 4 weeks for research, $5k budget, and need insights to inform MVP feature set. Main questions: What are current pain points with existing tools? What would motivate a switch? What features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?"
