## Chat Prompt

```
I need help preparing for coding interviews. Let's work on developing strong problem-solving approaches, practicing common patterns, and building confidence for technical interviews.

## Interview Context:
- **Target Companies**: [FAANG, startups, mid-size companies, specific companies]
- **Role Level**: [Junior, mid-level, senior, staff, principal]
- **Interview Format**: [Phone/video, whiteboard, laptop coding, take-home]

## Current Skill Assessment:
### Strengths:
[What are you already confident with?]
- Data structures you know well
- Algorithms you're comfortable with
- Problem types you can solve easily
- Previous interview experience

### Areas for Improvement:
[What do you want to work on?]
- Specific data structures (arrays, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithm categories (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Problem-solving speed
- Communication during problem solving
- Handling pressure and time constraints

## Practice Focus Areas:

### 1. Data Structures & Algorithms
**Core Data Structures:**
- [ ] Arrays and Strings
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks and Queues
- [ ] Trees (Binary, BST, Balanced)
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Tries

**Algorithm Categories:**
- [ ] Two Pointers / Sliding Window
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Sorting and Searching
- [ ] Tree/Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Backtracking
- [ ] Bit Manipulation

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach
**Structured Problem-Solving:**
1. **Clarification**: What questions should you ask about the problem?
2. **Examples**: How to work through examples to understand the problem?
3. **Approach**: How to identify the right algorithm or pattern?
4. **Implementation**: Best practices for clean, correct code?
5. **Testing**: How to verify your solution works?
6. **Optimization**: How to improve time/space complexity?

### 3. Communication Skills
- **Thinking Out Loud**: How to verbalize your thought process
- **Explaining Trade-offs**: Discussing time/space complexity
- **Handling Hints**: How to incorporate interviewer feedback
- **Asking Questions**: What clarifications to seek

## Practice Problems:
[What specific problems or topics would you like to work on?]

### Problem Categories:
- **Easy**: Warm-up problems to build confidence
- **Medium**: Core interview problems for your level
- **Hard**: Challenging problems for senior roles or top companies

### Specific Problem Types:
[Check areas you want to practice:]
- [ ] Array manipulation and searching
- [ ] String processing and parsing
- [ ] Tree problems (traversal, construction, validation)
- [ ] Graph problems (shortest path, connectivity)
- [ ] Dynamic programming (1D, 2D, optimization)
- [ ] System design coding (for senior roles)

## Mock Interview Practice:
### Interview Simulation:
- **Problem Presentation**: Practice receiving and understanding problems
- **Time Management**: 45-minute problem-solving sessions
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, readable code under pressure
- **Testing**: Debugging and validating solutions
- **Follow-up Questions**: Handling complexity analysis and variations

### Behavioral Integration:
- Explaining past projects while solving problems
- Discussing technical decisions and trade-offs
- Handling multiple approaches to the same problem

## Specific Help Needed:
[What particular aspects do you want to focus on?]

### Problem-Solving Strategy:
- "I get stuck on [specific type] problems - can you help me develop better approaches?"
- "I know the algorithms but struggle with implementation - need coding practice"
- "I solve problems correctly but too slowly - need efficiency improvement"
- "I get nervous and make mistakes - need confidence building"

### Technical Depth:
- "Help me understand when to use different data structures"
- "I need practice with complexity analysis and optimization"
- "Want to work on advanced algorithms like dynamic programming"
- "Need help with system design coding problems"

## Practice Session Request:
Would you like to:
1. **Work Through a Specific Problem**: I'll give you a problem and coach you through the solution process
2. **Review Algorithm Patterns**: Study common patterns and when to apply them
3. **Practice Communication**: Work on explaining solutions clearly
4. **Mock Interview**: Simulate a real interview experience
5. **Analyze Past Problems**: Review problems you've struggled with

## Success Metrics:
- Solve problems correctly within time limits
- Communicate approach clearly and confidently
- Write clean, bug-free code
- Analyze and optimize solutions effectively
- Handle follow-up questions and variations

Let's build your confidence and skills for coding interview success! What would you like to start with?

## Usage Tips
- Be specific about your target companies and role level
- Share examples of problems you've found challenging
- Practice explaining your thought process out loud
- Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Include time pressure in your practice sessions

## Follow-Up Areas
- **Problem Patterns**: Learning to recognize common problem types
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, readable code under pressure
- **Edge Cases**: Identifying and handling corner cases
- **Optimization**: Improving time and space complexity
- **System Design**: Coding system design components (for senior roles)

## Example Usage

"I need help preparing for coding interviews at FAANG companies for a senior software engineer role. I have 6 weeks to prepare and am comfortable with basic data structures but struggle with dynamic programming and graph algorithms. Interviews will be 45-minute coding sessions on a laptop. I tend to get the right approach but sometimes make implementation mistakes under pressure. Want to focus on medium to hard problems and improving my communication during problem solving."
